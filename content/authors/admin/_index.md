Hi! I'm Jun Chuan Chiew. I was born in Malaysia and I currently live in Taipei.

Currently, I'm working at ASUS-AICS as a Software Engineer. Before that, I have worked on several products which leverage Computer Vision  to do industrial application, such as smart checkout, survelliance. 

I believe that AI software productization can be beneficial to the society / world  and I hope I can make contribution in this field.
